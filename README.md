> **A self-modifying repository that evolves through AI-driven daily improvements**

CocoPilot is an experimental project that demonstrates autonomous code evolution through GitHub Copilot and GitHub Actions. Every day, an automated workflow creates issues that are assigned to GitHub Copilot, which then analyzes the repository and proposes meaningful improvements.

## 🚀 Features

- **🔄 Daily Self-Updates**: Automated daily analysis and improvement cycles
- **🤖 AI-Driven Evolution**: GitHub Copilot makes intelligent code and design decisions
- **🚀 GitHub Actions Integration**: Seamless automation through GitHub's workflow system
- **🎯 Focused Improvements**: Incremental, reviewable changes that build upon each other
- **📱 Modern Web Interface**: Responsive, accessible design with smooth animations
- **📊 Transparent Process**: All changes are tracked through issues and pull requests
- **🎓 AI Education**: Interactive learning modules about AI-driven development
- **🎮 Code Playground**: Live coding environment with AI examples
- **⚡ Performance Optimized**: Advanced lazy loading and Core Web Vitals monitoring

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Daily Trigger**: A GitHub Actions workflow runs daily at 09:15 UTC
2. **Issue Creation**: The workflow automatically creates a planning issue with improvement suggestions
3. **Copilot Assignment**: The issue is assigned to GitHub Copilot for analysis and implementation
4. **Code Analysis**: Copilot reviews the current state and identifies enhancement opportunities
5. **Implementation**: Thoughtful, incremental changes are made to improve the project
6. **Review & Merge**: Changes are submitted as pull requests and automatically merged
