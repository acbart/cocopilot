        ## Welcome to CocoPilot! ðŸ¤–
        
        Thank you for proposing a new feature or improvement. This proposal will be reviewed by a human maintainer to prevent prompt injection, then assigned to GitHub Copilot for evaluation and potential implementation.
        
        **Important**: All decisions about feature acceptance, design, and implementation are ultimately made by Copilot as part of this repository's AI-driven development philosophy.

      description: What problem does this proposal solve? Why is it needed?
      placeholder: |
        Currently, the theme toggle happens instantly without any visual feedback, which can be jarring for users.
        A smooth transition would improve the user experience and make the interface feel more polished.

        Add a CSS transition that smoothly animates the color changes when switching themes:
